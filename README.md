# Hacker News in Sidebar
## Notice: this addon is ***NOT*** currently published at addons.mozilla.org
A Firefox WebExtension to display [Hacker News](https://web.whatsapp.com/) in the sidebar.

This extension adds a new section to the Firefox sidebar which contains the Hacker News website.

Press `Alt+Shift+9` to open. This shortcut can be changed by going to Add-ons -> Hacker News in Sidebar -> Options.

## Disclaimer

This Add-on is primarily for personal use; a personal project if you will. I'm just trying to use Hacker News on the Firefox sidebar. This add-on just launches their website in the sidebar. This extension is an independent project, has no relationship, and is not affiliated to Hacker News in any way.
